The minimalistic and open-source social media. It may not be the best (and even quite buggy!), but it was my first major project. Credits to [Lama Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@LamaDev) for the backend API tutorial and some frontend help!

Feel free to fork and add your own changes. I am not planning to work on this project from now on, but I may still go through pull requests if there are any.
